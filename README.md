[00:29.76] My earliest memory
[00:39.02] Doesn't know who I used to be
[00:47.55] I take a glance at the trail left behind
[00:58.45] I trekked on and on living a world of influence
[01:21.95] 
[01:05.58] For what feels like eternity
[01:11.17] I let their every word control me
[01:15.37] But even now, I hold close words of my own
[01:20.47] Sentiments hidden away within
[01:34.97] 
[01:24.86] It's time to recollect again
[01:29.62] The dreams I had almost forgotten
[01:35.41] Then step towards another day
[01:42.85] My heart will guide the way
[01:56.35] 
[01:55.94] Never meant to be revealed
[02:05.78] Emotions always kept concealed
[02:13.85] Lost in my tracks with no sign to pursue
[02:24.79] Lingered in silence, not one single beacon glows
[02:48.79] 
[02:31.92] For what feels like eternity
[02:37.58] I let their answers cradle me
[02:41.53] But now I'm gonna disclose answers of mine
[02:47.08] Heed my inner voice and face ahead
[03:04.08] 
[02:51.15] It's time to recollect again
[02:56.13] The dreams I had almost given up on
[03:01.67] Then I may learn to be brave
[03:09.27] Thus keeping hope alive
[03:20.77] 
[03:12.85] Whenever we're lost
[03:17.66] Whenever we're hurt
[03:20.46] Times can be really tough
[03:25.55] Hard to stay strong enough
[03:29.96] However, I won't give up and I will believe
[03:40.52] Believe in this resolve of mine and mine only
[04:03.02] 
[03:48.89] For what feels like eternity
[03:54.13] I let their every word control me
[03:58.45] But now I'm gonna embrace words of my own
[04:03.74] This is where I will begin my life
[04:20.74] 
[04:08.08] It's time to recollect now
[04:12.73] The dreams that shed a light on my path
[04:18.62] Then I may learn to love myself
[04:26.14] A little more than before
[04:38.64] 
[04:34.50] Yeah, my life starts here
[04:40.38] My heart knows the way
